# Week-1 HTML CSS Git Challenge: Code Refactor

## Why I created this repo

I created this repo to help make this Horiseon webpage more accessible, by changing names of classes and adding comments for what each class and attribute do to the page.

## What my changes have solved

By changing the names to semantic html/css elements and adding descriptive notes to the CSS, I made the HTML and CSS easier to read. This helps others who work on the webpage after me- better understand the functions of the tags.

## What I learned from this project

I have a better understanding of why semantic elements are far more "beginner friendly" than div elements. I figured out a more consistent way of using all of my resources for problem-solving. I learned how to properly notate my css and html files and how to clone a repository so that I can make local changes and eventually push them to my own github repository.

<details> <summary> Full Process </summary>

Renamed all div classes to semantic tags based on the elements functions

Renamed section classes based on what section of the webpage they go to

Moved CSS attributes into sequential order of which they appear on the index.html file

Added notes on index.html file to describe the photos & what they depict

Added notes on style.css file to describe what the classes & attributes relate to

Changed Search Engine Optimization to an ID instead of a CLASS so the button/link would function properly

While updating the div tags to semantic, the banner no longer fit the webpage like it did originally. I resized it to fit as it should.

Pushed to remote repo

Updated README file one last time to summarize all my changes, as I pushed it all in one go instead of committing changes throughout the process.
