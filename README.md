# Week-1 HTML CSS Git Challenge: Code Refactor

## Why I created this repo

I created this repo to help make this Horiseon webpage more accessible, by changing names of classes and adding comments for what each class and attribute do to the page.

## What my changes have solved

By changing the names to semantic html/css elements and adding descriptive notes to the CSS, I made the HTML and CSS easier to read. This helps others who work on the webpage after me- better understand the functions of the tags.

## What I learned from this project

I have a better understanding of why semantic elements are far more "beginner friendly" than div elements. I figured out a more consistent way of using all of my resources for problem-solving. I learned how to properly notate my css and html files and how to clone a repository so that I can make local changes and eventually push them to my own github repository.

I had help from our AskBCS channel in slack with cloning the repo and making it my own and my classmates Brian Whisler & Jeremy Rapich -inside our discord channel- helped me better understand what to do with our starter code.
